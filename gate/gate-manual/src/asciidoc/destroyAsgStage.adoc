===== Destroy ASG Stage

====== Type

+destroyAsg+

====== Description

This stage destroys a named AutoScaling group across many regions.

CAUTION: This is a mortal finale to the AutoScaling group's existence. Even if Scaling Policies are suspended, or instances exist within the AutoScaling group, this operation will DEFINITIVELY, IRRECOVERABLY destroy the AutoScaling group.

TIP: Only use this operation if you're expecting that everything (EVERYTHING) in the AutoScaling group will go bye-bye.
