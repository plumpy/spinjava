===== Upsert Amazon Load Balancer Stage

====== Type

+upsertAmazonLoadBalancer+

====== Description

This stage orchestrates the creation of an Amazon Elastic Load Balancer. This stage performs an "upsert", which means that subsequent calls with the same inputs will be idempotent. Changes to the +securityGroups+, +listeners+, or +healthCheck+ fields will modify an existing load balancer, though all inputs can be supplied with every run.

|======================
|Key               | Type   | Required | Value
|name              | string | true     | The name of the load balancer.
|availabilityZones | object | true     | An object that provides a named region to array of availability zone relationships. For example, +{ "us-east-1": ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1c"] }+ will inform the deployment engine to deploy the ELB in the "us-east-1" region, and specifically into the availability zones: "us-east-1a", "us-east-1c". AutoScaling groups within the cluster MUST ALSO be in the same zones.
|securityGroups    | array  | true     | List of security *group names*. Their IDs in their particular regions will be found at Amazon -- no need to look them up in advance.
|listeners         | array  | true     | Listeners are a construct that map ports from an ELB to a port on an instance for which the ELB is servicing. A listener is a complex object that specifies: an "externalPort" -- the port that users will hit the load balancer with; an "internalPort" -- the port that the load balancer will send the traffic to on an instance; "externalProtocol" -- the protocol that the configured "externalPort" will accept traffic. This value is one of: "HTTP", "HTTPS", "TCP", or "SSL"; "internalProtocol" -- is the protocol with which the ELB will communicate traffic to the configured "internalPort" on the instance to which it is providing service; "sslCertificateId" -- is only necessary when the "externalProtocol" is configured as "SSL". There may be any number of listeners configured.
|credentials       | string | true     | The named account credentials that are to be used for this operation.
|healthInterval    | number | false    | Configures the interval, in seconds, between ELB health checks. Default: 10
|healthTimeout     | number | false    | Configures the timeout, in seconds, for reaching the +healthCheck+ target. Default: 5
|unhealthyThreshold| number | false    | Configures the number of unhealthy observations before deservicing an instance from the ELB. Default: 2
|healthyThreshold  | number | false    | Configures the number of healthy observations before reinstituting an instance into the ELB's traffic rotation. Default: 10
|crossZoneBalancing| boolean| false    | Indicates whether this ELB should balance traffic to instances in different zones. This should be enabled unless there's a real good reason not to do this. In the case of a zone failure or problem, the ELB should be able to delegate traffic to instances in other zones. Default: true
|subnetType        | string | false    | The subnet "type" that is applicable to this deployment. This instructs the deployment engine to what subnets and vpcs this deployment will be a part. Subnets that are tagged with the key "immutable_metadata" and a value of a structure like, +{ "purpose": "internal", "target": "ec2" }+, will be found by the engine, and their "purpose" may be used as a value type for this field. Note that "purpose" and "target" provide a composite key, where the "target" property has eligible values of one of: "ec2" or "elb". Only one "purpose" to "target" correlation is valid with respect to the "subnetType" field in this description.
|healthCheck       | string | false    | Specifies the health check target for this load balancer. Right now, this is just a pass-thru of what Amazon expects for an ELB health check's "target".
