|======================
|Key               | Type   | Required | Value
|recordType        | string | true     | Specifies the type of DNS record to create. Valid values for this field are one of "CNAME" or "A".
|name              | string | true     | The hostname to be created. This MUST be a sub-domain of the specified +hostedZoneName+, and must end with a dot (".").
|credentials       | string | true     | The named account credentials that are to be used for this operation.
|target            | string | false    | The target to which the DNS record will be attached. If the type is "CNAME", then this can be an existing hostname; if the type is "A", then this can be an existing hostname (and an ALIAS record will be created), or an IP Address (and a host record will be created). If this stage is preceded by an +upsertAmazonLoadBalancer+ stage, then this field does not have be included, and the DNS name of the load balancer created in the preceding step will be chosen. If both exist, then the specified target will be used.
