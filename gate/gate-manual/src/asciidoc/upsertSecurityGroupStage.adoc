===== Upsert Security Group Stage

====== Type

+upsertSecurityGroup+

====== Description

This stage will orchestrate the creation and update of a security group and its configuration at Amazon. This is an "upsert" operation, meaning that if no security group exists in the specified region, then one will be created. This orchestration will make the state of the security group reflect the supplied inputs. Permissions will not be appended to a security group, they will be reset and reapplied for each subsequent request.

This data structure of this array type contains the properties of +name+, +type+, +startPort+, and +endPort+. The +name+ field is the name of another security group in this region. The +type+ field can be one of: +tcp+, +udp+, +icmp+. The +startPort+ and +endPort+ define the port range that is to be made accessible to the target security group (which was defined by +name+).
