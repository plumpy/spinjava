Edda
---

Through the +AmazonClientProvider+, callers can get supply an [Edda](https://github.com/Netflix/edda/wiki) host as a String pattern in the form that formats to a hostname that includes a region and test (in that order) in the URL. For example: `http://edda.%s.%s.netflix.com` will be formatted to `http://edda.us-east-1.test.netflix.com` when I am requesting a client in "us-east-1" with an `AmazonCredentials` object that uses "test" as its environment.

Credentials
---

There sometimes is the need to draw an internal correlation of a given account to an arbitrarily named environment. To facilitate that relationship, this project projects an `AmazonCredentials` class, which provides that relationship to the `AmazonClientProvider`.
