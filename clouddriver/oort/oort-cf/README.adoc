== Cloud Foundry - OORT Concepts

OORT has a set of interfaces. The idea is to map Cloud Foundry concepts onto this model to get maximum support when plugging into the rest of spinnaker.

.OORT/Cloud Foundry relationships
[cols="2,2a,5a"]
|===
| OORT object | Details | Cloud Foundry object

|`Application`
|contains:

* 0..N `Cluster`

|Aggregation of all blue/green parts or single part of singular app.

* my-app

|`Cluster`
|contains: 

* 0..N `ServerGroup`
* 0..N `LoadBalancer`
* 1 account name


|Sides of a green/blue deployment, or None when not using that.

* my-app/blue
* my-app/green

or

* my-app

|`ServerGroup`
|contains:

* 0..N `Instance`
* 0..N `LoadBalancer`
* 0..N `SecurityGroup`
* 1 region
* 0..N zones
* 0..N launchConfig

|

* my-app/blue 
** Region(org): FrameworksAndRuntimes 
** Zone(space): development
** LoadBalancers(services): redis-service, mongodb-service
** launchConfig: CF env variables like SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production


|`LoadBalancer`
|contains:

* 0..N `ServerGroup`

|Services? CF apps have services, which can bind to multiple apps. Since `LoadBalancer` can map to multiple `ServerGroup`, this would fit the relationship, even if semantically it doesn't sound right. Possible to rebrand in the UI via metadata???

* redis-service => my-app/blue, my-app/green


|`Instance`
|contains:

* 0..N `ServerGroup`
* 0..1 zone

|Number of scaled instances of an app, whether blue/green/none type.

* my-app/blue #0 FrameworksAndRuntimes
* my-app/blue #1 FrameworksAndRuntimes


|`SecurityGroup`
|Part of MORT
|N/A


|Region
|The region in which the instances of this server group are known to exist

* contains 1..N zones
|Org

|Zone
|The zones within a region that the instances within this server group occupy.
|Space
