== Introduction

Kato is the library and micro-service that provides the Asgard 2 platform with the structure and RESTful HTTP interface for performing deployment and deployment related activities. Consumers of Kato can make use of its
 functions by posting an array of operation descriptions to the +/ops+ endpoint. These descriptions are, in turn, coerced to internal data structures and handed off to their respective handlers for
 processing.
